# Netflix-Catalog
Using the Netflix US Catalog database (from Kaggle),I created a Python program to access to the database using Pandas and a visual GUI (using tkinter). This program is able to navigate through records, search a specific Movie/TV Show using a unique Show ID or select a random Movie or TV Show and display the information using Pandas commands and features for the database(or dataframe) methods and Tkinter as a tool for setting an visual and user- friendly environment.
